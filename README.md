This app adds support for Nanoleaf.
There are some limitations to the official Homey Nanoleaf app and I like the extra flexibility of creating the app myself, hence the community version.
With the community version, it's much easier to give feedback on missing functionality; just create an issue for it when necessary.

Supported Capabilities:
- Turn On/Off
- Dim
- Previous Scene
- Next Scene
- Measure Power (estimated based on number of panels and dim level)

Supported Flows:
- Set Scene (free text input, matching scene name in Nanoleaf app)

Supported Devices:
- Nanoleaf Shapes

If you have another type of Nanoleaf and would like to help, please create an issue on Github to offer your help.
In case you feel there's missing functionality, again please create an issue and I'll get on it as soon as I can.
